    "1.Word embeddings capture semantic meaning by representing words as dense vectors in a continuous space. These\n",
    "vectors are learned from large amounts of text data using techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe. By training on \n",
    "co-occurrence patterns, word embeddings can capture semantic relationships between words. Similar words have\n",
    "similar vector representations, allowing models to capture meaning and make more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data.\n",
    "They have a recurrent connection that allows information to persist across different time steps. RNNs process\n",
    "input sequences one element at a time while maintaining an internal hidden state. This hidden state captures\n",
    "the context and sequential information, making RNNs effective for tasks like language modeling, sentiment\n",
    "analysis, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.The encoder-decoder concept is widely used in tasks like machine translation or text summarization. \n",
    "In this concept, the encoder processes the input sequence (e.g., source language sentence) and encodes it into\n",
    "a fixed-length representation called a context vector. The decoder takes this context vector as input and\n",
    "generates the output sequence (e.g., translated sentence or summary). The encoder and decoder can be implemented \n",
    "using RNNs or other neural network architectures, such as the Transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Attention-based mechanisms improve text processing models by allowing them to focus on relevant parts of the\n",
    "input sequence. Rather than relying solely on the hidden state of the encoder, attention mechanisms assign weights\n",
    "to different parts of the input sequence based on their importance to the current decoding step. This enables the\n",
